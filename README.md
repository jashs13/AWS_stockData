This project, "**Real-Time Data Streaming and Stock Data Analysis using AWS**," aims to harness the
robust, scalable, and efficient capabilities of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for dual, interconnected
purposes: the in-depth analysis of stock data and the implementation of real-time data streaming. We
specifically target stock data of significant technology companies collectively termed 'FANGMANT'
(Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla). It explores the fluctuations
and trends of the stock market for these companies, focusing on the period from June 1, 1997, to
December 12, 2023. This project covers the technical aspects of AWS services like Kafka, S3, EC2, Glue,
Athena, and QuickSight and delves into their practical application in handling and interpreting large
volumes of financial data.

**Project Structure**

The project is methodically divided into two main sections:

1. **Analysis of Stock Data**: We have tried to combine advanced cloud technologies with financial
analysis, providing a comprehensive and insightful look into the stock performance of some of the
world's leading tech giants, especially during periods of economic uncertainty and recession. This
section thoroughly examines the historical stock data of 'FANGMANT' companies. By leveraging
a combination of AWS services such as S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight, we aim to dissect and
understand these companies' market behaviors and financial patterns. The focus is on generating
statistical insights and interpreting the economic implications during various market phases,
including periods of economic uncertainty and recessions.

3. **Real-Time Streaming**: The second section pivots to the technical implementation and challenges
of real-time data streaming. Utilizing AWS's potent tools like Kafka, S3, and EC2, we aim to
simulate a real-time stock market environment. This involves streaming live data, managing it
efficiently in a cloud environment, and analyzing it in real-time. This part of the project
underscores AWS's technological prowess and adaptability in handling dynamic, high-volume data
streams typical in financial markets.
